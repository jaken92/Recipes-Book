# Recipe Book

Recipe Book is a webapp made with Laravel. Our goal was to deepen our knowledge in laravel while developing a platform where users can save, share and browse cooking recipes. The focus of this project has been the functionality in laravel, it is not finished in terms of responsivity and css. Most of the work has has been done "pair-programming". The project was developed by students [Johanna Pihl](https://github.com/Emma-Jonna) & [Petter Jakobsson](https://github.com/jaken92) of the Yrgo Webdevelop class of 2022.

# Instructions

Clone down the Recipes-Book repo from github https://github.com/jaken92/Recipes-Book and fire it up in your code-editor. Create your own database by running php artisan migrate. You´ll see an example of the .env file we use in development in .env.example - create your own .env file and update it with your credentials .
Run php artisan serve in the Recipes-Book folder and click the link appearing in the terminal to go to your local version of the webapp in your browser. From here, start by creating a user to acces all the features of the page. The database is empty, so you´ll need to add your own recipes and ingredients to see the functionality of some features, like filtering recipes by category and ingredients. Since there is no feature to add categories build in to the webpage, we suggest you copy the contents of the codestrips.txt file and run them in any controller to populate the categories table.
